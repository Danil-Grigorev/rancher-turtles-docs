Rancher Turtles is released as an Extension for Rancher, allowing traditional Rancher provisioning and Cluster API to be used side by side. That makes it a great fit for greenfield projects in addition to existing Rancher Manager users who can also benefit.

Rancher's Cluster API Extension is initially released as part of our early adopter program, enabling close collaboration with our customers, shaping jointly a mature solution that is battle proven. We are aiming to bring early Q1 Cluster API into GA and production support. If you are interested in joining our Early Adopter Program for Cluster API, don't hesitate to reach out.

If you want to get your hands wet, take a look at our documentation and give it a try. If you are stuck, have question or feedback, please ping us in the [Rancher Users #general slack channel](https://rancher-users.slack.com/archives/C3ASABBD1).
